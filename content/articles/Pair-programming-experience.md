This article is going to provide whys and hows of pair programming. Mind you, I don't have years of experience in this, but I happen to have few suggestions (REALLY, just a few) which will make dramatic difference in handling your day to day operations in your programming experience. These suggestions worked for me, so they can work for you too.

So why everyone is talking about benefits of pair programming, but virtually nobody pair programs apart from companies who enforce it from the start, coding events, meetups and workshops?

# Small introduction

Many people write a lot about benefits of pair programming, but I believe it's always about simplicity. So if we could boil these benefits down for the purposes of speculation, what is the single best reason to pair together up?

## FOCUS

The single most important reason of individual's or company's stagnation is **ego** which eats up your attention and the less ego pair programming partners will have the better experience will be, including better work and improved individual skills.

We have ideas about ourselves how good we are and what we know and this is a block to learning new things because it will mean that we don't have it. Our minds love to feel secure and hate change.

Pair programming is a great way to deal with this phenomenon. It's obvious when you don't know something just because other person is looking and you take outside perspective. But it's not everything.

## Experience

So you've made up your mind to try it out or maybe try it again after few failed attempts. You have an idea how good you are and - probably - you expect others to treat you like that. You sit down to a desk with your partner and this is what happens.

1. It's your turn.

    You start typing and your thoughts start wondering what he thinks of you (negative or positive).

2. Loosing focus.

    You go out of focus and have blurry eyes - you see this problem, but you think about something else (probably first point). He probably knows already and it's my turn ahhh.

3. Rush.

    You start typing a little bit too fast. Or maybe you started typing too fast from the beginning to get some esteem going - I feel sorry for you.

4. Confusion.

    Your breath gets shallow or is shallow from the start. Maybe you try to be a bit chatty, or even worse, stop caring completely about the other person and enforce onto him/her that you always know something even if you don't or show high end programming mannerism which shall indicate your seniority/good enough performance? Following Orwellian Newspeak, I feel **doubleplussorry** for you.

6. What partner really thinks.

    You start to think that your partner is superior and you see he/she takes it.

7. It's his/her turn.

    Maybe it goes the same way or not. You go back and forth with questions or one person codes and the other person just follows. In rare occasions both of you are doing fine which probably means that you have easy problem to solve or in even rarer occasions you are both good at pair programming.

8. Finish.

    It finishes with one going for two cups of coffee or maybe you try to prove yourself so badly that you stay there until you will receive few meaningless praises (which you probably already did to release the tension).

9. Afterthoughts.

    It all goes the way it goes and you rationalize that it was good or not good or that you are not meant to be pair programmer.

## What really happens

Pair programing is not meant to be implemented all the time or even half of the time. Everyone needs to be with themselves, but it a great tool for bringing you back to focus on your own self improvement and relinquishing you from ideas about yourself. When you think what other person thinks of you it's good and bad. Good, because finally you have a chance to see yourself working from a new perspective. Bad because it destroys your experience of happy coding.

I believe best programmers in the world are the way they are because they had very ambitious goal outside of themselves which didn't fuel ideas what others think about the person, but about written project which made their attitude impersonal. This turned all energy and attention into solving actual problem/achieving their objective.

This seems obvious, but I still don't see many people pair programming.

## Solution

So you are sitting together with your partner. Whether you know him/her or not doesn't matter. What matters is how you'll move on with actual experience. Probably you already know the answers, but like with everything laziness or maybe fear comes in and you forget to dig in a little deeper so you will be forced to act. These are just suggestions, but I think they will make tremendous difference.

1. Manage expectations.

    For the time of pairing up, believe it or not, you relate with your partner. And as in any relationship it's very important to know what your partner is expecting from you and vice versa. It needs to be **spoken out**! Just like in any relationship anger and resentment will move in if you will not match other person expectation - let's say you will try to help your partner when he/she wants to be seen as self-sufficient. This is tricky thing because everyone says they know that, but it never works because your monkey brain is going to try to guess if something wasn't said explicitly, which in turn will eat up precious energy. However many people just don't have the courage to do that, hence see the second point.

2. Prepare your attitude.

    If you are able to consistently hold your attitude without reaction to other person, no matter if your work is going well or not, he will start matching expectation and may do the same, but more probably will mistakingly assume your seniority. So what should your attitude consist of?

    Focus entirely on **yourself**. If you are more senior than other person you have time for introspection, but there is always something new to learn even from most junior developers. It's really easy to keep that attitude, even if the other person is screwing up - you can learn how not to screw up.

3. Follow up.

    Here you have time to focus on other person, but this is expected, hence less room for resentment to kick in. So after the session follow up with what you think about each other performances. Be tech rather then psych specific. Telling someone that should be more assertive won't do any good, but telling someone to read up few articles or write article on company's blog with his thoughts on the subject they were lacking knowledge on will make him/her assertive.

## Action

That's it. These suggestions are very obvious and simple, but hard to execute. Think about your objective. What you really want out of this tech career and if you really want to get more senior. You can always grow so there is no finish line, hence final suggestion is - **don't be lazy and take some action**.

If you hate all of my suggestions including the last one you are probably right. I believe I will make you happier with second final suggestion - relax, breathe and don't force anything on YOURSELF! It's not a rat race and you are not here to prove yourself, but learn something. So breath, relax, know what you want out of the session and  everything will take care for itself.
