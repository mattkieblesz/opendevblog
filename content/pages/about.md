Hello, I'm Matt. I specialize in backend development, especially within Python/Django environments in which I worked for around 5 years. Other skills include JavaScript, jQuery with more recent emphasis on ReactJS environments.

I love challenges, learning new technologies and pair programming.

Throughout my career I have been involved in my own startup pursuits, semi-large development teams as well as freelancing. Currently I live in London.

You can always shoot me an email so please [get in touch]({filename}contact.md).
